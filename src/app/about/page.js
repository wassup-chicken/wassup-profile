                    I’m Seung — a software engineer with a strong background in backend development, and enterprise systems.
                    I'm currently working on finance/accounting-related automation and SaaS integrations, and I love building tools that solve real-world workflow pain points.

                    I’m especially interested in:

                    🛠 Building backend services (Golang, Java)

                    🌐 Modern web apps using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS

                    🤖 Automating workflows and integrating business systems

                    Outside of coding, I love exploring product ideas, diving into new technologies, playing soccer, and spending quality time with my wonderful wife.`}
